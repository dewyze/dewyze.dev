I don't know if it's a result of growing up near the home of Deep Dish Pizza,
  using pizza as a way to survive being a picky eater, or just a simple human
  taste for pizza, but I am a fan.

Back in college, I watched an episode of _Throwdown with Bobby Flay_ where he challenged Mark Malnati (of [Lou
  Malnati's](https://www.loumalnatis.com/)). In that episode, I got to see the
  general glimpse of how pizza was made and thought, "I can do that." I
  proceeded to destroy several pizzas and rounds of dough trying to figure it
  out, but I eventually found a recipe and a system that worked.

In the last 2 years, I moved on from Deep Dish to Bread and simple _Neopolitan
Style_ pizzas. If you want to learn about the process, my attempts, and lessons
learned, click the picture below!
